/*This question requires a SQL pivot table. 

The logic of this query is:
Reshape Occupation into 4 columns with their index in each occupation, this leads to Temp table (which has many NULL).
Then group Temp by index and select corresponding Name for each Occupation.
min()/max() will return a name for specific index and specific occupation. If there is a name, it will return it, if not, return NULL.

You can just run the Temp table to see what it looks like, donâ€™t forget to include set statement. 
It will be very helpful if you break down the code and see the result.
