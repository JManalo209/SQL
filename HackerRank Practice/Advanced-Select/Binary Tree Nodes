SELECT n, 
CASE
WHEN (p is null) then 'Root' 
WHEN (n in (select p from bst)) then 'Inner'
ELSE 'Leaf' end 
FROM bst 
ORDER BY n;


--Line 4 looks for n in the 'p' column. If it exists in that column, it meants it has a "parent" value. Notice how the leafs 
(1, 3, 6, 9) do not have appear in the 'p' column, therefore making them at the bottom of the tree.
