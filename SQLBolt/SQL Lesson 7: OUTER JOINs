When joining table A to table B, a LEFT JOIN simply includes rows from A regardless of whether a matching row is found in B. 
The RIGHT JOIN is the same, but reversed, keeping rows in B regardless of whether a match is found in A. 
Finally, a FULL JOIN simply means that rows from both tables are kept, regardless of whether a matching row exists in the other table
